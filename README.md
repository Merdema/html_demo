# About This Project

This repository demonstrates the HTML, CSS, and Sass skills I have learned and started to apply.
While building this project, I practiced fundamental web development concepts such as semantic HTML structure, responsive design with CSS, and modular styling using Sass.

This work serves as a hands-on exercise to reinforce my understanding and to showcase my progress in front-end development.
